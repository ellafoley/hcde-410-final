# hcde-410-final

The goal of this project is to discover possible changes in crime rates in Seattle after major historical events have occurred. Specifically, this project will be investigating crime rates after Trumpâ€™s election, the death of George Floyd, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the data and line graphs will be used to visualize the results.

Note: I had to zip the dataset file to make it fit onto GitHub, so it will need to be unzipped before use.

The dataset used for this project can be found here: https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5.
